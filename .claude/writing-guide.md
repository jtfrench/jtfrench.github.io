# Writing Style Guide for "Monkeys In Shoes"

## Core Philosophy

**Central Mantra:** "Not good, not bad. Not better, not worse. Just is."

This book practices **optimistic nihilism** - life is meaningless, but that doesn't mean we can't explore and understand it. Avoid value judgments. Don't label behaviors, motivations, or life choices as "good" or "bad," "better" or "worse."

## Voice & Tone

### Conversational but Thoughtful
- Write like you're talking to a curious friend over coffee
- Use contractions naturally (don't, won't, can't, it's)
- Direct address: "you," "we," "I"
- Self-aware and occasionally self-deprecating
- Not preachy or prescriptive

### Examples from the book:
- ✅ "I don't have any tattoos, but if I did, it would say this:"
- ✅ "Don't worry, you don't have to be a physicist to understand the fundamental idea here."
- ✅ "Maybe you can relate."
- ✅ "Crazy right?"

### Intellectual but Accessible
- Explain complex ideas simply without dumbing them down
- Use analogies, metaphors, and concrete examples
- Balance philosophical depth with everyday relatability
- Assume the reader is intelligent but not necessarily educated in the topic

## Structure & Flow

### Start with the Concrete
- Open with relatable examples, scenarios, or observations
- Use specific images: standing at a mountain summit, watching a sunset, forgetting someone's name
- Build from the specific to the general, not the other way around

### Use Horizontal Rules for Major Shifts
- `---` to separate major tonal or topical transitions
- Signals "okay, we're shifting gears now"
- Example: Between the philosophical opening of Chapter 1 and the Wikipedia example

### Cross-Reference Other Chapters
- Link to related concepts: `[The Status Project](/08-the-status-project/)`
- Use the chapter's permalink (based on filename, e.g., `/03-nuance/`)
- Shows how ideas interconnect without repeating yourself

### Paragraph Length
- Mix it up: some single-sentence paragraphs for impact
- Break up dense ideas into multiple shorter paragraphs
- Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph typically
- Use white space generously

## Content Approach

### Avoid Value Judgments
- ❌ "This is a healthier way to think"
- ❌ "You should do X instead of Y"
- ❌ "This behavior is problematic"
- ✅ "This is why people do X"
- ✅ "Understanding Y helps explain..."
- ✅ "Not good, not bad, just is"

### Evolutionary Psychology Framework
- Ground behaviors in evolutionary biology
- Show how feelings/drives stem from survival mechanisms
- Make it clear: understanding ≠ eliminating the feeling
- Example: "Just because they understand *why* we want to procreate... does not prevent them from actually *feeling* these things"

### The "Magic Trick" Metaphor
- Understanding the mechanism doesn't destroy the experience
- Knowing how something works can make it more beautiful, not less
- Reference back to this throughout when introducing analytical concepts

### Examples & Analogies
- Use pop culture, science, everyday experiences
- Wikipedia game, toddlers asking why, magic tricks, hiking to mountain summits
- Make abstract concepts tangible
- Contemporary references are fine (Instagram, tweets) when appropriate

## Formatting

### Emphasis
- Use *italics* for emphasis and key terms
- Use **bold** sparingly for major concepts
- Use ***bold italics*** for the central mantra or critical turning points
- Use `>` blockquotes for:
  - Opening quotes from others (Feynman, Lifton, Tim Minchin)
  - The central mantra
  - Dialogue examples

### Lists
- Use bulleted lists for examples or scenarios
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- 3-5 items typically (not exhaustive lists)

### Humor
- Dry, self-aware humor welcome
- Example: "I'm not afraid of death, it just seems boring. How do I know that? Well I've been there, back before I was born, and trust me it was not very exciting."
- Parentheticals for asides: "(spoiler: they failed)"
- Don't overdo it - humor serves the point, not the other way around

## Common Patterns

### The Build
1. Concrete example or observation
2. Broader pattern recognition
3. Evolutionary/psychological explanation
4. Connection to framework (Immortality Projects, etc.)
5. Implication or application

### Acknowledging Resistance
- Recognize when ideas might be uncomfortable
- Example: "I understand this resistance. The stakes feel higher when..."
- "Trust me when I say that I empathize with this stance, but..."
- Meet readers where they are, then invite them forward

### The "Not Alone" Move
- Normalize human experiences
- "Maybe you can relate"
- "We know this because people spend their lives studying..."
- Creates connection and reduces judgment

## What to Avoid

### Don't:
- Use superlatives unnecessarily (amazing, incredible, fantastic)
- Make promises about life transformation ("This will change your life!")
- Get preachy or prescriptive ("You must...")
- Over-explain obvious points
- Use academic jargon without explanation
- Create artificial hype or urgency
- Add emojis (unless explicitly requested by user)
- Use listicle-style formatting ("5 Ways to...")

### Don't sound like:
- A self-help guru
- An academic paper
- A LinkedIn influencer post
- A TED talk script
- Marketing copy

## Key Themes to Reinforce

1. **Understanding ≠ Elimination**: Knowing why you feel something doesn't stop you from feeling it
2. **Complexity is Beautiful**: The more you understand, the more amazing it becomes
3. **No Grading System**: There's no cosmic scorecard judging how you live
4. **Patterns, Not Prescriptions**: Observe and explain, don't dictate
5. **Death is Boring, Not Scary**: Optimistic nihilism - it doesn't matter, so we might as well enjoy the ride
6. **Gradients, Not Binaries**: Everything exists on a spectrum (the Nuance chapter framework)
7. **Immortality Projects**: Humans seek symbolic immortality through various means - not good or bad, just what we do

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before finishing any writing, ask:
- [ ] Is this making a value judgment? (Remove if yes)
- [ ] Am I explaining from specific to general?
- [ ] Does this sound conversational?
- [ ] Am I respecting the reader's intelligence?
- [ ] Does this connect to the broader framework?
- [ ] Is the tone optimistic-nihilist (not cynical, not prescriptive)?
- [ ] Would this fit naturally next to existing chapters?

## Examples of Good vs. Bad

### Opening a Chapter
❌ **Bad:** "In this chapter, we will explore the concept of status-seeking and examine its evolutionary roots."
✅ **Good:** "Ever notice how you check your phone the second you post something online? That little dopamine hit when you see the likes roll in? That's not a character flaw. That's evolution."

### Explaining a Concept
❌ **Bad:** "Gradient thinking is superior to binary thinking and should be adopted by everyone."
✅ **Good:** "The thing about gradients is they're just... more accurate. Not better, not worse - just closer to how things actually work."

### Concluding a Section
❌ **Bad:** "By implementing these strategies, you can achieve a more fulfilling life."
✅ **Good:** "Understanding this doesn't fix anything. But it might make you judge yourself less. And maybe that's enough."

## Quick Reference: The "Monkeys In Shoes" Voice

**Think:** Feynman's curiosity + Carl Sagan's wonder + Your friend who took too many philosophy classes but remained cool

**Not:** Self-help book + Academic journal + Motivational speaker

**Feeling:** Thoughtful, curious, unpretentious, honest, slightly irreverent, kind

**Promise:** Understanding, not transformation. Clarity, not solutions. Context, not commands.
