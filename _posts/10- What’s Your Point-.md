# 10. What’s Your Point?

If you’ve ever come across any Budhist text or teachers, you’ve probably heard something along the lines of “dont try, just be”. It’s a favouite lesson amongst Budhist circles to preach this idea of acceptance with what life throws at you. On the surface its a beautiful idea, one that seems to make sense to some people, but it fucking drives me nuts. Why? Well it all goes back to our earlier disucussion on binary vs gradients. “Trying” is a gradient word, there are different extents to which one can try. To truly not try to do a trying would literally mean just laying down and never fucking moving again. Defenders of the lesson would say “well obviously not that, you still have to eat and use the bathroom and such” and BAM, those actions have invalidated the original statement and now the discussion becomes the extent to which we should try, which is no longer easily defined and subject so opinion. How much beyond eating and shitting should we try? At the end of the day, everyone’s respective answers to this question are more easily understood from their actions then anything they could possibly say. (To be expanded upon) 

The solution I’ve managed to convince myself is as follows: 
Not good, not bad
Not better, not worse 
Just is

It means this: you should still try in life, you should continue to pursue the things that make you feel good even if you dont really understand why they make you feel that way, but you should do so without believing in any sort of cosmic order of things. In other words, you might as well try because in the end it doesn’t fucking matter so just do what makes you feel good. If that’s not good enough for you then fine, be depressed and miserable, because that doesn’t fucking matter either. In my mind you might as well join Team Try because its a lot more fun but fuck it, in the end it doesn’t really matter -  because nothing actually matters. 

You should do the things you want but with the understanding that when something doesn’t go as planned, it doesn’t really matter. It’s a difficult idea to wrap your head around, because up until now you’ve only ever done things because they mattered in some way.
