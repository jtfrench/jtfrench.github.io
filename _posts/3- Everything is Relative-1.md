# 3. Everything is Relative 

[Need to build foundation about how different experiences form “all we know” and the unfair comparisons people make with each other]

All of our communication, written and verbal, is done through language. This communication has become so easy and reflexive that I think we often forget what exactly words mean, and more importantly, what type of words they are. 

As a kid I was terrible with grammar, “Language Arts” or so it was called where I am from, was usually my worst subject. However I’ve now come to realize how a simple understanding of grammar and definitions would come to solve most modern day arguments. 

There’s really only two pieces of grammar to review: 
- Noun: A noun is a word that generally functions as the name of a specific object or set of objects, such as living creatures, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas.
- Adjective: An adjective is a word that describes or defines a noun or noun phrase. Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun.

So when I say something like “He is a **terrible person**.”; the adjective is “terrible” and the noun is “person”. The important distinction that I will continue to come back to throughout this book is that adjectives are **relative** while nouns are **binary**. What I mean by this is that everyone has different definitions of what “terrible” is to them. Anything that is relative implies the usage of a **gradient**. For example, your personal definition of terrible consists of a gradient with the most terrible thing you can possibly think of at one end, and the least terrible thing you can think of at the other end. The issue with adjectives/relative words is that everyone has different items at the end of the spectrum. The most terrible thing you can think of is a **product of your experiences up to this point**. 

Imagine your a child who has just reached the age where they can understand and communicate using language. If I were to ask this child what the most terrible thing they can think of is, they might say something like “punching someone”. Then if I were to ask an adult the same question, they would probably say some sort of combination of rape, murder, genocide, torture, etc. 

Now when we use a word like “terrible” without any relative comparison, people associate with the collective understanding of their definition of the word. Because language often moves so fast, we don’t stop to think about this fact. Because everyone has such different experiences, when compounded together, the same statement can have very different meaning to different people with different life experiences.
