# 4. Immortality Projects 101

Humans dont want to die. “Well yah, no shit” you say, “nobody wants to die”. I mean like you really dont want to die, so badly in fact that everything you do, and I mean everyone, is because you dont want to die. Allow me to explain…

This idea is, that we as humans have developed a sort of coping mechanism to deal with the fact that we know we will one day be dead. We’re the only species that is truly conscious of this fact. “Well animals are also afraid to die, that why they protect themselves” you say. Yah I know, but those animals done have the brain power to understand that one day they will be dead, but that the world around them will keep on spinning, and that they were just but a mere speck in this great cosmic insignificance. We humans on the other hand are aware of this fact, and it startles us so much that we have developed what Mark Manson has coined “Imortality Projects”.
