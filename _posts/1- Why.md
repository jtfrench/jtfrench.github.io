# 1. Why

At the end of the day, this book is about the central question of: why? Why are we here? Why do we look this way? Why do I care about other people? Why am I even reading this book? Chances are, there was a time in your adolescent years where these questions first crossed your mind, but you never found the answers to them and none of the adults seemed all that bothered with them, and so you just kind of moved on. Besides, there was more real and tangible stuff going on like sports and movies and girlfriends/boyfriends and so you just kind of figured that they weren’t really that important. 

Point being, you never really got answers to these questions, and for a while it didn’t concern you, but now its kind of starting to. Why are so many people living out of vans? Why do I need to have kids? Why do I get bored of the same sexual partner? Why do I want the big house and fancy car? Why do I kinda of want to just escape it all? Lots of why-based questions with not a lot of answers.  

Theses an underlying level of angst amongst the younger generations of this world, a sort of staring into a dark void kind of vibe that emanates throughout the population. We’re all kind of thinking it, but everyone’s telling themselves “yah but this is just what living is like, I’m sure all the previous generations had their own version of this”. 

Well I’m here to tell you, that generally speaking, they didn’t. Now this is where you picture your older relative mocking you with “you know, back in my day…” lines and so you dont allow yourself to consider it. Well just indulge me for a moment.

The reason I say “generally speaking” is because I am now going to list out some statistics that may or may not be relevant:
Rates of religion are at an all type low across the world
Suicide rates are at an all time high across the board 
For the first time ever, our population is declining 
More people report increasing levels of anxiety then ever before, across the world 

Now consider the idea that all of these statistics come back to the central question of: why? We, as a human race, are asking the question of “why?” more then we ever have before. A lot of that is because, for the longest time, we weren’t capable of asking questions at all (but dont worry, we’ll get to that). I’m not a big fan of small talk, and so in order to try and make conversations interesting, especially when I’m talking with someone new, I like to play what I call ‘The Why Game’. It goes something like this: 
	Me: “So what do you like to do on the weekends?”
	Them: “I really enjoy going to concerts.
	Me: “What do you like about concerts?”
	Them: “I just really like the vibe of being totally immersed in something with other people that we all enjoy.”
	Me: “Why do you like that vibe?”
	Them: “Hmm, well I guess because it feels like we’re all experiencing this thing, the music, which seems to transcend us at an individual level.”
	Me: “Why is it important to experience something like that with other people?”
	Them: “Okay this is sorting to get annoying, but I guess because it creates this sense of community and that feels good”
	Me: “Why is a sense of community important?”
	Them: “Well I dont know I just like it okay, I gotta go.”

This is about the point where most people flip on their cognitive dissonance blinders and stop playing the ‘Why Game’; could because they sim play dont know the answer anymore, or it could be because thinking about it any further begins to creep into a realm of unknowing meta questions that make them uncomfortable. It’s especially fun to play with people who seemingly have everything figured out: 

	Me: “What do you do for a living?”
	Them: “I’m an investment banker.”
	Me: “Why do you do that?”
	Them: “Well because its kinda interesting but mostly because it pays really well.”
	Me: “Why do you want a job that pays really well?”
	Them: “Because I like living comfortably and providing for my family.”
	Me: “Why does it matter if you live comfortably and provide for your family?”
	Them: “Well because it feels good to be comfortable and because I love my family.” 
	Me: “Why do you love your family?”
	Them: “Well that’s a weird question man… I just do”

Once again, we reach the point where we seemingly can’t play the ‘Why Game’ anymore as we have reached what seems like the final answer. However, what this book is about in a nutshell is the continuation of the ‘Why Game’ to its actual conclusion.
