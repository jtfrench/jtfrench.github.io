## About this site 
This site is what I call an agile book; a combination of a blog and an actual book. Unlike a blog, the topics remain fairly static, but the content changes as we refine the ideas; hence the word "agile".

The best part of all is that to make this book truly agile, the content is all hosted on a public repository called GitHub. This allows you, the reader, to go back and see the old versions of the entire site; in other words you can see how the ideas have evolved. However, the best part is that you can suggest changes to the content through a process called "pull requests". The hope here being to promote collaboration, discussion, and consesnsus on each of the topics. 

## Topics
The current topics are (with more to be added in the future):
* [Everything is Relative](/iCloud/monkeyinshoes/everything is relative.md)
* [The Binary Bias](/iCloud/monkeyinshoes/the binary bias.md)
