"We're just fucking monkeys in shoes" are the final lyrics from the Tim Minchin song ["Confessions"](https://youtu.be/p1EhaANeYCI?si=9BTk09ZE8blTcF0M). The song is a metaphor about the continual battle we humans face between biology and culture; the monkey representing biology and the shoes representing culture. This book, in its purest form, is an attempt to merge these two worlds in a way that is both logical and understandable. It is my belief that a unified understanding of *why*, why we are here and why we do the things we do, would lead to a better world.

On a personal note, this book is my (main) immortality project; my attempt at putting something out into the world that extends beyond me. When I think about my own eventual death, this is the one thing that I want to leave behind. As with any good Immortality Project, this is not something that can ever be completed which is part of the reason why I have it in a website form - I can continue iterating on it until the end. Upon my eventual demise I hope to leave it in a state which is cohert, and either way I hope someone can take the ideas within and develop them further, continuing the layering of knowledge that is the essence of what makes human evolution so amazing.
