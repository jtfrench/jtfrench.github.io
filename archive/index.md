## What is a monkey in shoes?!?
Great question, "monkey in shoes" is a term borrowed from the Australian commedian Tim Minchin in his song 'Confessions'. I highly suggest you watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1EhaANeYCI).

If you cant be bothered, ill give you the jist of it. 'Confessions' is a song about the juxtaposition between important cultural issues (femanism, poverty, enviornmentalism) and the innate mamalian desires that all of us humans posess. For me, the song is a reminder to balance life between a cultural purpose (a [Causa Sui](https://dasein.foundation/projects) project if you will) and the basic mamalian activites we all enjoy (love, companionship, intimacy, childern, excercise, eating, shitting, etc.). Near the end of the song, Minchin sings "we're just fucking monkeys in shoes" which I thought was a beautiful, simple, and concise metaphor for the song as a whole. 

We are each our own "monkey in shoes", trying to navigate this complex world while balancing our mamalian/evolutionary desires with our cultural purpose. This site is an attempt at helping to further this pursuit for all. As much as possible, the framework used here is one of logic and evolutonary psychology. I hope you enjoy, learn, and contribute. 

## About this site 
This site is what I call an agile book; a combination of a blog and an actual book. Unlike a blog, the topics remain fairly static, but the content changes as we refine the ideas; hence the word "agile".

The best part of all is that to make this book truly agile, the content is all hosted on a public repository called GitHub. This allows you, the reader, to go back and see the old versions of the entire site; in other words you can see how the ideas have evolved. However, the best part is that you can suggest changes to the content through a process called "pull requests". The hope here being to promote collaboration, discussion, and consesnsus on each of the topics.
